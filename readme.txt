"ENF figure" contains 10 hours of ENF data of diffenrent of different time collected from Gazipur,Bangladesh.

The Electric Network Frequency (ENF) is the supply frequency of power distribution networks, which can be captured by multimedia signals recorded near electrical activities. It normally fluctuates slightly over time from its nominal value of 50 Hz/60 Hz. The ENF remain consistent across the entire power grid. This has led to the emergence of multiple forensic application like estimating the recording location and validating the time of recording. Recently an ENF based Machine Learning system was proposed which infers the region of recording from the power grids ENF signal extracted from the recorded multimedia signal, with the help of relevant features. In this work, we report ENF data extraction process from Power Recording data of Bangladesh National Grid and used the ENF data to compare available power recordings data from online database [10]. We used a set of features from [7] which serve as identifying characteristics for detecting the region of origin of the multimedia recording. We used those characteristics in a multiclass machine learning implementation based on MATLAB which is able to identify the grid of the recorded signal
